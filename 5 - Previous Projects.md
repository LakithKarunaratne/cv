The project involved a stripped-down version of Linux with the base kernel and the drivers required to operate the system. The system is then able to balance the resources between two OSâ€™s as if its running native on the same hardware. The user is able to switch between two operating systems by using a combination of keys. The handover of resources is handled automatically without causing disruption to the workflow.
